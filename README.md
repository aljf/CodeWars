## Unique In Order
Implement the function unique_in_order which takes as argument a sequence and returns a list of items without any elements with the same value next to each other and preserving the original order of elements.

## Simple Fun #2: Circle of Numbers
Consider integer numbers from 0 to n - 1 written down along the circle in such a way that the distance between any two neighbouring numbers is equal (note that 0 and n - 1 are neighbouring, too).

Given n and firstNumber/first_number, find the number which is written in the radially opposite position to firstNumber.

## Simple Fun #40: Timed Reading
Timed Reading is an educational tool used in many schools to improve and advance reading skills. A young elementary student has just finished his very first timed reading exercise. Unfortunately he's not a very good reader yet, so whenever he encountered a word longer than maxLength, he simply skipped it and read on.

Help the teacher figure out how many words the boy has read by calculating the number of words in the text he has read, no longer than maxLength.

Formally, a word is a substring consisting of English letters, such that characters to the left of the leftmost letter and to the right of the rightmost letter are not letters.

## Beginner - Reduce but Grow
Given a non-empty array of integers, return the result of multiplying the values together in order. 

## Stop gninnipS My sdroW!
Write a function that takes in a string of one or more words, and returns the same string, but with all five or more letter words reversed (Just like the name of this Kata). Strings passed in will consist of only letters and spaces. Spaces will be included only when more than one word is present.
